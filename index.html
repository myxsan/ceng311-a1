            Hello I am Musa. I initially began my software journey by learning the fundamentals with C. I spent a year primarily concentrating
            on game development and expanded my knowledge to include C# for creating games in Unity. However, I aspire
            to continue my career in the web development field, recognizing the need to broaden my skill set. At present, I'm
            diligently enhancing my software development skills with a focus on web development and actively pursuing job
            opportunities within the web industry.
